        <h3 class="lb_heading">Yumyulack</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Yumyulack is very cunning, crabby, sly, and likes pulling pranks. He
          claims that one of the reasons he's perceptive is because he's a
          scientist and loves doing "sci-fi shit". Yumyulack claims that he used
          to be a bounty hunter back on planet Shlorp, which could explain why
          he is able to make quick work out of the bar full of Neo-Nazis and
          know how to use advanced tech like shrinking rays. Yumyulack has a
          knack for outer-limits pranks and torturing people. He hijacks his
          school's Mac computers in order to program his own artificial
          intelligence into them as an elaborate joke, puts people in pods,
          shrinks his classmate to pour Diet Coke in her exposed brain, and
          lobotimizes her, all because she teased both him and Jesse. He also
          harbors people whom he shrank using a shrink ray, and stores them in a
          place called The Wall. He claims to be doing these pranks to "study
          the human condition". After Korvo and Terry advise him not to torture
          fellow classmates, he complies, but still tests on and experiments
          with adults. Yumyulack says he does this because they "love it"
          although that much is debatable, as they are constantly seen in pain,
          and looking for methods to escape.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Terry</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Terry is a very laid-back, open-minded and friendly alien. Unlike his
          introverted partner Korvo, he is fairly optimistic about his entry
          onto planet Earth, and seems very indifferent about the fact that
          there are many forms of sentient life on Earth. Despite being an
          immigrant to Earth, he is very open-minded about Earth's customs. He
          has a very gregarious disposition and is always excited to learn and
          try new things on earth. He takes a liking to some customs in Earth -
          like purchasing lottery tickets, watching TV (shows like Funbucket),
          going to dog parks, dogs, and donating money. His outlook seems to be
          that he wants to have as much fun as possible on Earth and to seek
          cheap thrills from the planet. Terry is also shown to be very caring
          and kind to those he cares about. Although Korvo tends to dismiss
          Terry's cries for affection, Terry is constantly shown complimenting
          him and even goes as far as to cheer Korvo up about the fact that
          their planet got destroyed.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Korvo</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Korvo is a very introverted pessimistic and closed-minded individual.
          He hates Earth and even makes a point to mention that in the opening
          sequence. He is insistent on not assimilating, preferring to stay in
          the house and fix the ship as soon as possible so they can leave. He
          finds most if not all of earth's inhabitants and customs stupid. Like
          Yumyulack, Korvo is cold, cunning and serious. Compared to Terry,
          Korvo is hard working, and studious gaining him the label as “the
          smart one”. He also prioritizes the mission above all else and
          constantly wishes that Terry and their family would spend their time
          focusing on it. He has been the only one working on repairing the ship
          but to no avail. Despite his dislike of Earth, he begrudgingly tries
          to learn from the others and adapt to Terry's insistence, sometimes
          changing his mind and occasionally even having fun.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Jesse</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Unlike Yumyulack, she is optimistic, free-spirited, and compassionate,
          much like Terry. Jesse enjoys talking to people and finding the
          positive attributes of life on Earth. She is worshiped in the wall as
          a saint as her periodic habit of throwing candy and other odds and
          ends into the wall out of pity is primary source of "supplies" for the
          people of the wall.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Pupa</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          The Pupa's level of intelligence seems to fluctuate. While it normally
          behaves like an ignorant pet or infant, it has shown moments of
          extreme intelligence, brutality, and cruelty. It is shown to have a
          hobby and interest of watching what goes on in The Wall, often
          appearing in the background and even humorously recording Tim and
          Cherie having sex with a smartphone. It also appears to understand
          what is going on inside, though its interest appears similar to that
          of someone watching a TV show. It is also shown to enjoy playing with
          its Harry Potter Wand Whistle, which it goes to great lengths to get,
          such as reuniting a son and his father, or going into a woman's dream
          while offering therapy.
